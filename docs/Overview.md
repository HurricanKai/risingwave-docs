RisingWave is a cloud-native streaming database that uses SQL as the interface language. It is designed to reduce the complexity and cost of developing and using a stream processing platform so that developers can build applications more efficiently. It ingests streaming data, performs the processing that you specify (aggregates, joins, maps, enrichment, etc.), and dynamically updates the results. As a streaming database, RisingWave stores the results so that users can access them in real-time.

RisingWave ingests data from sources like Kafka, Apache Pulsar, Amazon Kinesis, Redpanda, and materialized CDC sources.

**SQL as the interface**

RisingWave makes it easy to manage streams and data. All you need to interact with RisingWave is Postgres-compatible SQL. No Java or Scala codes are needed. 

**Elastic and cost-effective**

As a cloud-native platform, RisingWave is super elastic. You can dynamically adjust the compute and storage resources based on your actual requirements.

RisingWave is cost-effective. You pay for what you use as you scale. As compute is decoupled from storage in RisingWave, they can be scaled separately. In addition, RisingWave stores data in object storage systems (Amazon S3 and S3-compatible systems). The storage cost is down significantly compared with other centralized solutions that store data in expensive data warehouses.

**Real-time results via materialized views**

With RisingWave, you define the data you need as materialized views. As new data come in, RisingWave only performs incremental aggregations as the results for previous events have already been calculated, thus reducing the processing time significantly. To further lower the latency, we optimized the storage processing logic for complex computations and high-concurrency scenarios. Queries can be processed and results can be delivered with low latency even in these demanding circumstances.

Results of materialized views are stored in RisingWave. You can issue a query to find out the latest result of a materialized view. 

**Data are correct and consistent**

When data are processed in batches, if a job goes wrong, you can do some troubleshooting and rerun the job. However, itâ€™s not practical to rerun a stream processing job, because the stream never ends. In stream processing, it is crucial that data are calculated correctly and events are not missed or calculated twice. Otherwise, the data will not match data in upstream or downstream systems.

In RisingWave, data correctness is ensured by a snapshot-based mechanism. Every time a snapshot is triggered, the internal states of each operator will be flushed to the cloud storage. Upon failovers, the operator recovers from the latest checkpoint on the cloud storage. 

## Architecture

RisingWave includes these key components:

* A serving layer that parses SQL queries and performs planning and optimizations of query jobs.
* A processing layer that performs all the data computation and status updates.
* A meta server that coordinates the operations between the serving layer and the processing layer.
* A persistence layer that stores data to and retrieves data from object storage like S3.
